# Facial-Expression-Recognition-System-Using-ML
•	Develop a machine learning algorithm model based on CNNs trained using facial expression datasets, then test, deploy, and evaluate it on the task of accurately classifying seven facial emotions (surprise, happiness, sadness, fear, anger, disgust, and neutral).
•	We explore and recognise the benefits of using convolutional neural network models rather than utilising any of the other machine learning models. 
•	Investigate both the benefits and drawbacks of using CNNs in the field of images of facial expressions. 
•	Conduct research on the hyper parameters, attributes, and training techniques used by CNN. 
•	Conduct research into and develop an understanding of the process of recognising facial expressions from images. 
•	In order to train CNNs, investigate several options for hardware and software that are both efficient and quick.
•	Create a graphical user interface (GUI) programme in Python to accomplish the task of recognising seven different online facial expressions. 
•	Examine and evaluate the accuracy of the application in a variety of environments, including those with varying lighting and poses, as well as those with some of the face covered. 
•	Conduct research on a variety of hyper parameters and the effect that each of these factors has on the precision of the models.
